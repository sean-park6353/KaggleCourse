#! Introduction

# *The random forest uses many trees,
# * and it makes a prediction by averaging the predictions
# *  of each component tree.
# * It generally has much better predictive accuracy than
# * a single decision tree and
# * it works well with default parameters.
# * If you keep modeling, you can learn more models
# *  with even better performance,
# * but many of those are sensitive to getting
# * the right parameters.
